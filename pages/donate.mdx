            # Donations

            Thank you for considering making a donation to the foundation.
            We greatly appreciate your support and generosity.

            Unfortunately, due to the laws of the Principality of Liechtenstein, we are unable to accept anonymous
            donations.
            In order to comply with local regulations, we require all donors to provide their name and contact
            information.

            We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Thank you for your understanding and support. Your
            donation will
            make a real difference and will help us to continue our work.
            Your information will be kept confidential and will only be used for the purposes of processing your
            donation and
            issuing a tax receipt, if applicable.

            We accept donations from organizations or individuals. If you wish to donate, please email us at:
