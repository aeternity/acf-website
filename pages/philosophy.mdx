# Our Philosophy
Empowering people, businesses & open-source blockchain technology advancement

We are not æternity blockchain, nor its owners and managers.
We are contributors, just like numerous community members & projects, taking care of the smooth flow of the blockchain, continuous development, technology advancement, and empowerment of its ecosystem.

**We are one of many organizations that cares deeply about æternity technology — its innovations, values & scalability.**

Research, development, innovations, community learning & building opportunities,
Ambassador Programs and Grant Opportunities - it is not just what we do but how we do it.
However, we are a foundation, and thus we continue to fund development of many significant
components of the æternity ecosystem, together with:
* Building æternity blockchain ecosystems through global, open source collaboration
* Taking care of the core blockchain development, security, and advancement
* Foster the development and adoption of cross-industry platforms powered by distributed ledgers
* Educate the public
* Empower, support and promote open source blockchain community to continuously develop ecosystem and technology

**Foundation is dedicated to driving Web 3.0; a decentralized and fair internet where users control their own data, identity and destiny.**

Potential partners and grantees are welcome to contact the Foundation for proposals to take æternity leaps ahead.

Let’s build æternity together.
