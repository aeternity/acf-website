After leaving Ericsson, Ulf joined Erlang Solutions as CTO. He then entered the\nConnected Device market first via the startup Feuerlabs, then as a freelance contractor to Jaguar\nLand Rover, and Lead Developer of GENIVI’s Remote Vehicle Interaction component. Ulf joined the\nAeternity Core Team in 2017 and is now busy exploring and developing blockchain technology. In the\nOpen Source arena, Ulf is perhaps best known for components like Gproc, Jobs, and Exometer. In his\nspare time, Ulf doubles as an opera singer and dabbles in politics.\n",
