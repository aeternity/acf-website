Ulf Wiger has been using Erlang since 1992, bought the first-ever commercial license in 1993 and has
been a full-time Erlang dev since 1996. While at Ericsson, he became something of an Erlang
ambassadeur, speaking about the AXD 301 ATM Switch/Media Gateway and about how Erlang works in large
industrial projects. After leaving Ericsson, Ulf joined Erlang Solutions as CTO. He then entered the
Connected Device market first via the startup Feuerlabs, then as a freelance contractor to Jaguar
Land Rover, and Lead Developer of GENIVIâ€™s Remote Vehicle Interaction component.

Ulf joined the Aeternity Core Team in 2017 and is now busy exploring and developing blockchain
technology. In the Open Source arena, Ulf is perhaps best known for components like Gproc, Jobs, and
Exometer.

In his spare time, Ulf doubles as an opera singer and dabbles in politics.
