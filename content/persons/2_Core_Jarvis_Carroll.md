Jarvis has experience in high performance programming, including work with the real-time
neuroscience hardware used by the Australian startup Cortical Labs. He also has education in pure
mathematics and programming languages through his bachelor of science, including an original
research project into novel paradigms in quantum computation for which he earned First Class
Honours. Since 2023 he has started working with the Aeternity Crypto Foundation to contribute to
tooling and automatic optimization for the Sophia smart contract language, so that contract
programmers can further benefit from the performance of Aeternity's cutting edge FATE virtual
machine.
