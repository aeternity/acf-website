Lale joined the team with a high level of interest in supporting the Aeternity Crypto Foundation in
their important role in pioneering blockchain technology and its surrounding systems. Working in the
field of accounting for a blockchain project creates interesting new tasks and challenges. With her
bilateral experience, she is a great fit to support the mission. In August 2019 she finished her
Marketing-Communications apprenticeship in a renowned, Berlin-based accounting company. Previously
she supported various start-ups as an online marketing- and accounting manager.
