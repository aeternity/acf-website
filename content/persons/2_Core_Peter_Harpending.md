Peter first started using Aeternity in early 2022 as part of a commercial project. He came to
believe that Aeternity is by far the easiest and most robust electronic payment solution for the
majority of commercial use cases. Peter now works on tooling, libraries, and documentation, with the
goal of improving the overall quality of life for both end-users and developers interacting with
Aeternity. Peter has a background in pure mathematics and functional programming.
